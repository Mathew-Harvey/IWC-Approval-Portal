# Multi-Jurisdiction Research Summary
## In-Water Cleaning (IWC) Regulatory Frameworks

*Research Date: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the regulatory research conducted for adapting the IWC Approval Portal to support multiple jurisdictions: **Australia (current), New Zealand, Singapore, USA, and Japan**.

The research reveals that while core operational requirements (fouling assessment, AFC types, capture technology) are largely universal based on IMO guidelines, each jurisdiction has distinct:
- Regulatory bodies and approval processes
- Notification requirements and timelines
- Document templates and terminology
- Risk thresholds and triggers
- Prohibited substances lists
- Emergency contacts and ports

## 1. Australia (Western Australia) - CURRENT BASELINE

### Regulatory Framework
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Primary Regulator** | DPIRD (Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development) |
| **Port Authority** | Fremantle Port Authority (FPA) |
| **Key Regulations** | Australian Anti-fouling and In-water Cleaning Guidelines (Exposure Draft 2024), FPA OEMP |
| **Biosecurity Authority** | DAFF (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) |

### Approval Process
1. Submit notification package to FPA and DPIRD
2. DPIRD reviews vessel history, confirms acceptable risk
3. Pre-clean inspection by DPIRD-recognised inspector (≥48hrs before clean)
4. DPIRD clearance to proceed
5. If IMS detected → site to DPIRD custody
6. Post-clean inspection and final report (≤20 business days)

### Risk Thresholds
- **High Risk Triggers**: FR ≥90, non-regional biofouling, IMS suspected, AFC damaged/unknown/expired
- **Capture Required**: FR 30-80 hull cleaning, biocidal AFC grooming, niche areas
- **No Capture**: FR ≤20 non-biocidal AFC grooming, propeller polish (FR≤80, ≤5% cover)

### Prohibited Biocides
- Diuron, Cybutryne, Ziram, Tributyltin (TBT), Chlorothalonil

These elements are consistent across all jurisdictions based on IMO guidelines:

### IMO Biofouling Guidelines (MEPC.207(62))
- Biofouling Management Plan required
- Biofouling Record Book
- Risk-based approach to cleaning decisions
- AFC within service life
- TBT prohibition universal

### Anti-Fouling Systems Convention (AFS)
- TBT compounds banned globally
- Other harmful compounds progressively restricted

### Fouling Assessment
- Level of Fouling (LOF) scale widely adopted
- FR (Fouling Rating) 0-100 used in Australia/NZ
- Visual assessment methodology consistent

## 8. Recommendations for Implementation

### Architecture Approach
Given the significant variation in regulatory bodies, approval processes, and documentation requirements, recommend:

1. **Jurisdiction-as-configuration pattern** - Each jurisdiction defined in a separate config file
2. **Template parameterization** - All templates use variables, not hardcoded text
3. **Scenario logic overrides** - Allow jurisdiction-specific risk thresholds
4. **Modular emergency contacts** - Separate hospital/diving emergency databases
5. **Port database** - Searchable port list per jurisdiction
6. **Document localization** - Date formats, phone formats, terminology

### Priority Order for Implementation
1. **New Zealand** - Closest regulatory alignment to Australia, English documentation
2. **Singapore** - Strong maritime infrastructure, English documentation
3. **USA** - Complex due to state variation, start with California
4. **Japan** - Language considerations, documentation may need translation support
